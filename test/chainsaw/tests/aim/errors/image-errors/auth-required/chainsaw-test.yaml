    Test that when a service is created with a private image (without credentials):
    1. Auto-created AIMModel shows ImagePullAuthFailure error
    2. No templates are created (metadata extraction failed)
    3. AIMService propagates the error from model

    try:
    - apply:
        file: service.yaml
