                  Filters define which images to discover and sync.
                  Each filter specifies an image pattern with optional version constraints and exclusions.
                  Multiple filters are combined with OR logic (any match includes the image).

                    ModelSourceFilter defines a pattern for discovering images.
                    Supports multiple formats:
                    - Repository patterns: "org/repo*" - matches repositories with wildcards
                    - Repository with tag: "org/repo:1.0.0" - exact tag match
                    - Full URI: "ghcr.io/org/repo:1.0.0" - overrides registry and tag
                    - Full URI with wildcard: "ghcr.io/org/repo*" - overrides registry, matches pattern
                  properties:
                    exclude:
                      description: |-
                        Exclude lists specific repository names to skip (exact match on repository name only, not registry).
                        Useful for excluding base images or experimental versions.

                        Examples:
                        - ["amdenterpriseai/aim-base", "amdenterpriseai/aim-experimental"]
                        - ["silogen/aim-base"] - works with "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (registry is not checked in exclusion)

                        Note: Exclusions match against repository names (e.g., "silogen/aim-base"), not full URIs.

                        Image pattern with wildcard and full URI support.

                        Supported formats:
                        - Repository pattern: "amdenterpriseai/aim-*"
                        - Repository with tag: "silogen/aim-llama:1.0.0" (overrides versions field)
                        - Full URI: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-google-gemma-3-1b-it:0.8.1-rc1" (overrides spec.registry and versions)
                        - Full URI with wildcard: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (overrides spec.registry)

                        When a full URI is specified (including registry like ghcr.io), only images from that
                        registry will match.

                        If specified, overrides the global Versions field.
                        Only tags that parse as valid semver are considered (including prereleases like 0.8.1-rc1).
                        Ignored if the Image field includes an explicit tag (e.g., "repo:1.0.0").

                        Examples: ">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0", "~1.2.0" (patch updates), "^1.0.0" (minor updates)

                        Prerelease versions (e.g., 0.8.1-rc1) are supported and follow semver rules:
                        - 0.8.1-rc1 matches ">=0.8.0" (prerelease is part of version 0.8.

                  Versions specifies global semantic version constraints applied to all filters.
                  Individual filters can override this with their own version constraints.
                  Constraints use semver syntax: >=1.0.0, <2.0.0, ~1.2.0, ^1.0.0, etc.
                  Non-semver tags (e.g., "latest", "dev") are silently skipped.

                  Version ranges work on all registries (including ghcr.io, gcr.io) when combined with
                  exact repository names (no wildcards).
