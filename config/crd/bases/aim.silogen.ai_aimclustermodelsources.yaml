          AIMClusterModelSource is the Schema for the aimclustermodelsources API.
          It automatically synchronizes container images from a registry and creates
          corresponding AIMClusterModel resources for discovered models.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                        Image is a wildcard pattern for matching image repository paths.
                        Supports glob-style wildcards with '*' matching any characters.
                        Pattern is matched against the repository path (excluding registry and tag).
                        Examples:
                          - "aim-models/*" matches all images in the aim-models repository
                          - "llama-*" matches all images starting with "llama-"
                          - "*/mixtral-8x22b" matches "mixtral-8x22b" in any repository
