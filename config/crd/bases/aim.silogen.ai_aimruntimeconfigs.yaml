                  Routing controls HTTP routing defaults applied to AIM resources.
                  When set, these defaults are used for AIMService resources that enable routing
                  but do not specify their own routing configuration.

                      When true, the operator creates HTTPRoute resources for services that reference this config.
                      When false or unset, routing must be explicitly enabled on each service.

                      The gateway can be in any namespace (cross-namespace references are supported).
                      If routing is enabled but GatewayRef is not specified, service reconciliation will fail

                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed.
