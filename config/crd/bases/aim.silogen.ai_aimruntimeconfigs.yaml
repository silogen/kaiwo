                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed.

                      PathTemplate defines the HTTP path template for routes, evaluated using JSONPath expressions.
                      The template is rendered against the AIMService object to generate unique paths.

                      Example templates:
                      - `/{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}` - namespace and service name

                      RequestTimeout defines the HTTP request timeout for routes.
                      This sets the maximum duration for a request to complete before timing out.
                      The timeout applies to the entire request/response cycle.
                      If not specified, no timeout is set on the route.
                      Individual services can override this value via spec.routing.requestTimeout.
