          KaiwoQueueConfig manages Kueue resources like ClusterQueues, ResourceFlavors, and WorkloadPriorityClasses based on its spec. It acts as a central configuration point for Kaiwo's integration with Kueue. Typically, only one cluster-scoped resource named 'kaiwo' should exist. The controller ensures that the specified Kueue resources are created, updated, or deleted to match the desired state defined here.
          KaiwoQueueConfig manages Kueue resources.
