                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                          If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                          If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                          recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                          If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                            RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                            recursively.

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                            recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.
