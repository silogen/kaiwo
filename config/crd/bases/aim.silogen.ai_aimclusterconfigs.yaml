                          to the local namespace of the Route.

                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed.
